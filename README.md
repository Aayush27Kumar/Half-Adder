# Half-Adder
Half Adder is a type of combinational logic circuit that adds two of the 1-bit binary digits.

The half adder has two inputs A and B, and two outputs S (sum) and C (carry).
The half adder circuit uses an XOR gate and an AND gate to perform the addition operation.

The sum bit is the result of the addition operation for the least significant bit (LSB) position, and is determined by performing a logical XOR operation on the A and B bits. 
The carry is for the most significant bit (MSB).
